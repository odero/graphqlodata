# GraphQLOData Middleware

A middleware translates graphql to odata

## Next steps:
- [x] handling entityset queries
- [x] handling functions and actions
- [x] handling variables
- [ ] translate to $expand, query fields that have selection sets
- [ ] translate updates and deletes to patch and delete (not post)
- [ ] translating fragments
- [ ] handling custom filtering module e.g. for playground and hasura
- [ ] response pipeline to convert odata response to graphql response
- [ ] generate graphql schema from odata schema to allow graphql introspection by tools like graphiql
